Tjis was created as modification for #ReactAdvanced project which was deployed at https://arnhem-front-end.site and used MongoDB as a database.
In this implementation added Redis client for tracking users IP (througe the class implemented in IpTracker.js) and as following to rendering an events in #ReactAdvanced which was created only the user which now 
using this app 
(for this purpos for this purpose exploited methods from IpTracker class in body of get request from server side to React app )
, or events from #ReactAdvanced which was created by local host (so, as "127.0.0.1" in data base at Mongo).
Ð•he disadvantage is that the IP address is not always representative of one user, therefore, for the purpose of identifying a single user, it is still better to work with cache.
This project in full implementation can be watched at site https://www.ryzhov.website/home/  .
